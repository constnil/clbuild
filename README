clbuild 2.0
===========

http://gitorious.org/clbuild2
git clone git://gitorious.org/clbuild2/clbuild2.git


This is clbuild 2.0, a shell script with the following features:

  - clbuild makes it easy to start Lisp and SLIME with a good default
    configuration

  - Used a wrapper for Quicklisp, it automatically downloads Quicklisp
    if needed, and has command line argument quickload Lisp projects
    from the shell.

    In this mode, all downloading and dependency tracking for Lisp
    projects is done by Quicklisp and ASDF.

  - Like classic clbuild from darcs, the current version still supports
    download from projects directly from upstream's version control.

    If you choose this installation method for a project, the
    version-controlled checkout overrides any previous installation made
    by Quicklisp.

Usage
-----

See
  ./clbuild --help
  
Commands are:

  Software installation and quicklisp interaction:
  
    quickload SYSTEM        ensure that SYSTEM has been downloaded
    system-list             list systems available through quicklisp
    system-apropos FOO      list systems matching FOO
    update-all-dists        update all dists downloaded using quicklisp
    update-dist DIST        update this dist
    update-client           update the quicklisp client
    
  Software installation from version control (overrides quicklisp):
  
    install-from-upstream PROJECT...   install projects from upstream
    upstream-list           list projects available from upstream
    upstream-apropos FOO    list projects matching FOO
    trash PROJECT...        remove project
    
  Lisp invocation:
  
    prepl                   run Lisp on the terminal (with line editing)
    lisp                    run Lisp on the terminal (raw)
    slime                   run Lisp (using Emacs and SLIME)
    ed [PATHNAME|SYMBOL]    run the CL function ED (uses usercore.conf)
    
  Housekeeping and utilities:
  
    rm-cores                clean out previously dumped core files
    slime-configuration     show information on how clbuild starts slime
    help                    this help
    compile-implementation  compile SBCL
    
Important configuration files:

  clbuild.conf  (make a copy of  clbuild.conf.example and edit it)
  conf.lisp     (make a copy of     conf.lisp.example and edit it)
  usercore.conf (make a copy of usercore.conf.example and edit it)


History
-------

This version of clbuild (maintained in git) is a slighly refactored fork
of the classic clbuild script (maintained in darcs).

classic clbuild was written by Luke Gorrie and contributors.
Idea from jhbuild by James Henstridge (a Gnome hacker).
